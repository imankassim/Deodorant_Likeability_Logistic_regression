# Deodorant_Likeability_Logistic_regression

This is my first logistic regression model, looking at deodorant likeability in the general population.

The dataset I used was the 'Deodorant Instant Liking Data' published on Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/ramkumarr02/deodorant-instant-liking-data

I would recommend running the notebook in Google Colab - as you can run the individual code blocks seperately to better understand the process. There is a link above the Jupyter Notebook!
